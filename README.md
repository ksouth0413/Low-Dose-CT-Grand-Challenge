## **‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing**
1. **Normalization**:
   - Pixel values scaled from **(-1000, 2000)** to **(-1, 2)**.  
2. **Patch Division**:
   - Original images (**512√ó512**) divided into **81 patches** of size **55√ó55**.  
3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - ResNet50 extracted features to compute cosine similarity (~**0.996**) between LDCT and NDCT patches, ensuring consistency.
